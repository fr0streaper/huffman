# Huffman encoding/decoding library + console utility
This was implemented for a C++ course at ITMO University

The library provides an interface to encode and decode files using Huffman algorithm. 

In perspective, it also may allow encoding and decoding data without directly using files, but whether this feature will be implemented or not is unknown.

Console utility provides a simple CLI to encode and decode any kind of files - even ones larger than RAM.
